# Typing Speed Data Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of typing speed data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
The project explores relationships between typing speed, fingers used, and accuracy.

## Dataset
- Rows: 168595
- Columns: 11

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Questions Explored
- Does finger count affect WPM?
- Correlation between accuracy and speed
- Distribution of typing speeds
- Does age and native language affect typing speed?
- Country that has the highest speed

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
